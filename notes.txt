Yes, you can deploy your app on Heroku without adding a credit or debit card. Heroku provides a free tier, and you can deploy and run applications on this free tier without any need for payment information.

Here's a basic overview of the process:

Create a Heroku Account:

If you don't have a Heroku account, you can sign up for free at https://signup.heroku.com/.
Install Heroku CLI:

Download and install the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI) from https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli.
Login to Heroku:

Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
bash
Copy code
heroku login
This will open a browser window for you to log in to your Heroku account.
Navigate to Your Project:

In your terminal, navigate to the directory where your Node.js application is located.
Create a Procfile:

Heroku uses a Procfile to determine how to run your application. Create a file named Procfile (no file extension) in your project's root directory and specify the command to start your server. For example:
makefile
Copy code
web: node your-server-file.js
Initialize a Git Repository:

If your project isn't already a Git repository, initialize one:
bash
Copy code
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Create a Heroku App:

Run the following command to create a new Heroku app:
bash
Copy code
heroku create
Deploy Your App:

Deploy your app to Heroku using Git:
bash
Copy code
git push heroku master
Open Your App:

Once the deployment is complete, you can open your app in the browser using:
bash
Copy code
heroku open
Your app is now deployed on Heroku's free tier without the need to add a credit or debit card. Keep in mind that the free tier has limitations, and if your app exceeds those limitations, you might need to upgrade your Heroku account or consider other hosting options.
