# Fun-Chat

Fun-Chat is a basic, real-time group chatting application built as a learning project to understand and work with Web Sockets using the socket.io library. This application focuses solely on group conversations, making it a lightweight and straightforward example of real-time communication without the complexity of one-on-one messaging.

## Learning Experience

Fun-Chat served as a foundational project in my journey to grasp real-time communication technology, specifically through Web Sockets and the socket.io library.

- **Socket.io Integration:** Uses socket.io for efficient, event-driven, real-time communication.

- **Minimalist UI:** A clean and simple interface focused on enabling dynamic group interactions without additional features.

## Tech Stack

- **Socket.io:** For real-time communication via Web Sockets.
- **Node.js:** The backend runtime environment.
- **Express** Lightweight Node framework for routing and server configuration.
- **HTML & CSS:** Basic front-end to create a simple, intuitive interface.
